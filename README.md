Links in the OneDrive will be updated should anything change. Still, familiarise yourself with how to pull raw data from the GitHub. I will explain this, only takes two minutes.

R contains all R scripts we write. Please label neatly.

data contains 2 subfolders:
data/raw stores the raw data received from the SAI
data/processed stores the cleaned data. 

We can add and remove as we need. Lets make this GitHub really really cool.
